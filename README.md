## Problem Statement

Over the past century alone, around 400 languages – about one every three months – have gone extinct, and most linguists estimate that 50% of the world’s remaining 6,500 languages will be gone by the end of this century (some put that figure as high as 90%, however). Today, the top ten languages in the world claim around half of the world’s population. 

Since there are so many imperilled languages, it’s impossible to label just one as the rarest or most endangered, but at least 100 around the world have only a handful of speakers

Some people argue that language loss, like species loss, is simply a fact of life on an ever-evolving planet. What’s more, languages are conduits of human heritage. Writing is a relatively recent development in our history (written systems currently exist for only about one-third of the world’s languages), so language itself is often the only way to convey a community’s songs, stories and poems. 

Another argument mirrors that of biodiversity conservation. Just as ecosystems provide a wealth of services for humanity – some known, others unacknowledged or yet to be discovered – languages, too, are ripe with possibility. They contain an accumulated body of knowledge, including about geography, zoology, mathematics, navigation, astronomy, pharmacology, botany, meteorology and more. 

## Object
Our object was to create a model that classifies each language on the basis on their extinction probability

## Data Description

UNESCO provide a classification system to show just how 'in trouble' the language is:
```
1)Vulnerable - most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)

2)Definitely endangered - children no longer learn the language as a 'mother tongue' in the home

3)Severely endangered - language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves

4) Critically endangered - the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently

5) Extinct - there are no speakers left
```
